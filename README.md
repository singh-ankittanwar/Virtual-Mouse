# Virtual-Mouse
Mouse in no more a hardware component. You can use your fingers as a mouse.

My Environment:
OS: Windows 10,
Python: version 3.6.4
OpenCV: version 3.1.4

How this works:
1. Run the .py file (it'll open your camera)
2. Put a green tape (or anything green) on your forefinger and thumb
3. Place your forefinger and thumb in the camera (nothing else must be green except your finger and thumb)
4. Keep your thumb and forefinger open to move the cursor
5. Keep your thumb and forefinger close to use the mouse's left click button. You can also drag an icon while clicking.
